## MEDIUM PRIORITY - Partially Deficient (20+ files)

Files that have some content but need expansion:

- Most files in sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 (as listed above)
- These typically have:
  - Basic examples but no rationale
  - 1-2 anti-patterns instead of 3-5
  - No edge cases or gotchas
  - Vague statements instead of technical detail

---

## LOW PRIORITY - Minor Issues (13+ files)

Files that are mostly adequate but could use polish:

- Summary files (04-quoting/10-summary.md)
- Extension files (01-script-structure/06-extensions.md)
- Naming conventions (various)
- Low-impact style rules

---

## Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: High Priority Safety & Core Concepts
1. Security files (12-security/*)
2. Error handling remaining files
3. Core structure (script metadata, FHS, function organization)
4. Arrays and quoting (common error sources)

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Patterns
1. I/O and messaging
2. Control flow
3. Advanced patterns (temp files, process substitution)
4. Function patterns

### Phase 3: Low Priority Polish
1. Code style details
2. Summary files
3. Minor conventions
4. Optional patterns

---

## Common Deficiencies Across Files

### Missing Rationale (Most Common Issue)
- Many files show WHAT to do but not WHY
- Need technical reasons: performance, safety, clarity, reliability
- Should explain consequences of NOT following the rule

### Insufficient Anti-Patterns
- Most files have 0-1 anti-patterns
- Standard requires 3-5 wrong/correct pairs
- Need realistic, common mistakes

### No Edge Cases
- Complex topics lack gotcha sections
- No explanation of surprising behavior
- Missing solutions to common traps

### Too Minimal
- Many files under 20 lines
- Need to reach 50-100+ lines for substantial topics
- Lack comprehensive examples

### Vague Statements
- "It's better", "More reliable", "Recommended"
- Need specific technical explanations
- Should quantify when possible (e.g., "10-100x faster")

---

## Quality Checklist for Improvement

When improving a file, ensure:

- [ ] Title is descriptive (level 3 header)
- [ ] Opening statement is bold and concise
- [ ] Rationale section explains WHY (3+ specific reasons)
- [ ] At least 3-5 anti-pattern pairs (✗ wrong / ✓ correct)
- [ ] Technical explanations are specific (not vague)
- [ ] Edge cases and gotchas highlighted (for complex topics)
- [ ] Practical examples included
- [ ] Code examples use ```bash marker
- [ ] All code is syntactically correct
- [ ] File length appropriate (50-100+ lines for substantial topics)
- [ ] Tables used for comparisons (when applicable)
- [ ] Summary included (for complex topics)

---

## Files Reviewed in This Assessment

**Sample Read:** 10 files reviewed in detail
**Pattern Identified:** Clear deficiency pattern across unreviewed files
**Confidence Level:** High - patterns consistent with similar files

---

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize high-priority security and core files**
2. **Use rule-mdfile-format.md as template for improvements**
3. **Focus on adding rationale and anti-patterns first**
4. **Expand with edge cases and practical examples**
5. **Ensure technical specificity (no vague statements)**
