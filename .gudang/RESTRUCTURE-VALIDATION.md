## Content Moved Between Sections

| Content | From → To | Lines | Verified |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Function Organization example | Section 3 → Section 1 | 72 | ✅ Line 92 |
| Readonly Declaration | Section 11 → Section 2 | 7 | ✅ Line 242 |
| Arithmetic Operations | Section 13 → Section 7 | 25 | ✅ Line 974 |
| Checking Return Values | Section 11 → Section 8 | 20 | ✅ Line 1031 |
| Builtin vs External | Section 11 → Section 13 | 14 | ✅ Line 1582 |
| Input Sanitization (trimmed) | Section 15 → Section 12 | 27 | ✅ Line 1402 |

## Content Removed (True Redundancy)

| Item | Lines | Reason | Verified |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| Duplicate function list in Functions | ~18 | Full implementation exists in Section 9 | ✅ |
| Summary section | 9 | Generic bullet points, no value | ✅ |
| Excessive input sanitization examples | ~20 | Kept 2 core examples (filename, number) | ✅ |
| Logging implementation details | ~25 | Trimmed to pattern-focused (~25 lines) | ✅ |
| Performance profiling extras | ~30 | Removed memory/benchmark, kept SECONDS/EPOCHREALTIME | ✅ |

**Total removed: ~102 lines**

## Critical Rules Validation

### All Core Patterns Preserved ✅
- ✅ Script metadata pattern (VERSION, SCRIPT_PATH, SCRIPT_DIR, SCRIPT_NAME)
- ✅ shopt recommendations (inherit_errexit, shift_verbose, extglob, nullglob)
- ✅ `set -euo pipefail` requirement
- ✅ Boolean flags pattern (declare -i)
- ✅ Derived variables pattern
- ✅ Readonly after group pattern
- ✅ Variable expansion guidelines (ALL 131 lines preserved)
- ✅ Quoting rules (ALL 238 lines preserved - demoted one-word literal to note)
- ✅ Standard utility functions (_msg, vecho, success, warn, info, error, die, yn, noarg)
- ✅ Case statement formats (both compact and expanded)
- ✅ Argument parsing pattern with short options
- ✅ Process substitution over pipes
- ✅ `#fin` marker requirement

### All Examples Preserved ✅
- ✅ Variable Expansion Guidelines - all examples intact
- ✅ Quoting Rules - all examples intact
- ✅ Boolean Flags - all examples intact
- ✅ Derived Variables - all examples intact
- ✅ Error handling patterns - all examples intact
- ✅ Dry-Run Pattern - FULLY preserved (exemplary content)
- ✅ Progressive State Management - FULLY preserved (exceptional content)
- ✅ Testing Support Patterns - FULLY preserved

### All Security Rules Preserved ✅
- ✅ Never use SUID/SGID
- ✅ PATH security (lock down or validate)
- ✅ Avoid eval
- ✅ IFS manipulation safety
- ✅ Wildcard expansion safety (rm ./*)
- ✅ Input sanitization patterns

### All Best Practices Preserved ✅
- ✅ 2-space indentation (never tabs)
- ✅ 100-character line length
- ✅ ShellCheck compliance (compulsory)
- ✅ Comments explain WHY not WHAT
- ✅ Blank line usage guidelines
- ✅ Section comment patterns
- ✅ Command substitution ($() not backticks)
- ✅ Builtin vs external commands
- ✅ Script termination (#fin)
- ✅ Defensive programming
- ✅ Performance considerations
- ✅ Testing support

## Summary Tables Preserved ✅
- ✅ Variable Expansion Summary Table (line 469)
- ✅ Quoting Summary Reference Table (line 673)

## Advanced Patterns Validation ✅
- ✅ Debugging & Development - preserved
- ✅ Dry-Run Pattern - FULLY preserved (exemplary)
- ✅ Temporary File Handling - preserved
- ✅ Environment Variable Best Practices - preserved
- ✅ Regular Expression Guidelines - preserved
- ✅ Background Job Management - preserved
- ✅ Logging Best Practices - trimmed to ~25 lines (pattern-focused)
- ✅ Performance Profiling - trimmed to ~25 lines (SECONDS + EPOCHREALTIME)
- ✅ Testing Support Patterns - FULLY preserved
- ✅ Progressive State Management - FULLY preserved (exceptional)

## Document Integrity Checks ✅
- ✅ Starts with "# Bash Coding Standard"
- ✅ Contains 14 sections (verified via grep)
- ✅ Ends with "#fin" marker
- ✅ All section headers present
- ✅ Table of contents matches section structure
- ✅ Line count: 2,145 lines

## Improvements Achieved ✅

### Structural Coherence
- ✅ Error handling unified (was fragmented across 2 sections)
- ✅ Variable topics unified (all readonly content in Variables section)
- ✅ String topics clarified (expansion vs quoting clearly separated)
- ✅ Eliminated incoherent "Calling Commands" grab-bag section

### Navigation
- ✅ Related topics grouped logically
- ✅ Clear section focus (each section addresses one cohesive topic)
- ✅ Better discoverability (content where users expect it)

### Clarity
- ✅ Split complex "String Operations" into focused sections
- ✅ Organized "Best Practices" into themed subsections
- ✅ Reduced noise (removed duplicate function list, generic summary)

## Conclusion

**ALL RULES PRESERVED ✅**
**ALL EXAMPLES PRESERVED ✅** (only Advanced Topics selectively trimmed as planned)
**STRUCTURE IMPROVED ✅**
**NAVIGATION ENHANCED ✅**

The restructuring successfully achieved:
- 4.5% size reduction through elimination of true redundancy
- Significantly improved structural coherence
- Better navigation and discoverability
- Zero loss of rules, guidelines, or critical examples
- Enhanced clarity through logical organization

**Status: VALIDATED ✅**
