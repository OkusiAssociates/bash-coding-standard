### read
read [-ers] [-a aname] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name
...]
 One line is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor fd supplied as an argument to the
 -u option, split into words as described above under Word Splitting, and the first word is assigned to
 the first name, the second word to the second name, and so on.  If there are more words than names, the
 remaining words and their intervening delimiters are assigned to the last name.  If there are fewer
 words read from the input stream than names, the remaining names are assigned empty values.  The
 characters in IFS are used to split the line into words using the same rules the shell uses for
 expansion (described above under Word Splitting). The backslash character (\) may be used to remove
 any special meaning for the next character read and for line continuation.  Options, if supplied, have
 the following meanings:
 -a aname
  The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable aname, starting at 0.  aname
  is unset before any new values are assigned.  Other name arguments are ignored.
 -d delim
  The first character of delim is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.  If delim
  is the empty string, read will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
 -e If the standard input is coming from a terminal, readline (see READLINE above) is used to obtain
  the line.  Readline uses the current (or default, if line editing was not previously active)
  editing settings, but uses readline's default filename completion.
 -i text
  If readline is being used to read the line, text is placed into the editing buffer before
  editing begins.
 -n nchars
  read returns after reading nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input,
  but honors a delimiter if fewer than nchars characters are read before the delimiter.
 -N nchars
  read returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of
  input, unless EOF is encountered or read times out.  Delimiter characters encountered in the
  input are not treated specially and do not cause read to return until nchars characters are
  read.  The result is not split on the characters in IFS; the intent is that the variable is
  assigned exactly the characters read (with the exception of backslash; see the -r option below).
 -p prompt
  Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any
  input.  The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
 -r Backslash does not act as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part of the
  line.  In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not then be used as a line continuation.
 -s Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
 -t timeout
  Cause read to time out and return failure if a complete line of input (or a specified number of
  characters) is not read within timeout seconds.  timeout may be a decimal number with a
  fractional portion following the decimal point.  This option is only effective if read is
  reading input from a terminal, pipe, or other special file; it has no effect when reading from
  regular files.  If read times out, read saves any partial input read into the specified variable
  name.  If timeout is 0, read returns immediately, without trying to read any data. The exit
  status is 0 if input is available on the specified file descriptor, or the read will return EOF,
  non-zero otherwise.  The exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded.
 -u fd  Read input from file descriptor fd.

 If no names are supplied, the line read, without the ending delimiter but otherwise unmodified, is
 assigned to the variable REPLY.  The exit status is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times
 out (in which case the status is greater than 128), a variable assignment error (such as assigning to a
 readonly variable) occurs, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.
