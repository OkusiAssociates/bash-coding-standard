# Error Handling

This consolidated section establishes comprehensive error handling practices for robust scripts. It mandates `set -euo pipefail` (with strongly recommended `shopt -s inherit_errexit`) for automatic error detection, defines standard exit code conventions (0=success, 1=general error, 2=misuse, 5=IO error, 22=invalid argument, etc.), explains trap handling for cleanup operations, details proper return value checking patterns, and clarifies when and how to safely suppress errors (using `|| true`, `|| :`, or conditional checks). Error handling must be configured before any other commands run to catch failures early.
