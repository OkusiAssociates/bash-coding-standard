# Functions

This section defines function definition patterns, naming conventions (lowercase_with_underscores), and organization principles. It mandates the `main()` function for scripts exceeding 200 lines to improve structure and testability, explains function export for sourceable libraries (`declare -fx`), and details production optimization practices where unused utility functions should be removed once scripts mature. Functions should be organized bottom-up: messaging functions first, then helpers, then business logic, with `main()` lastthis ensures each function can safely call previously defined functions and readers understand primitives before composition.
