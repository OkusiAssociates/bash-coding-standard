# Command-Line Arguments

This section establishes the standard argument parsing pattern supporting both short options (`-h`, `-v`) and long options (`--help`, `--version`), ensuring consistent command-line interfaces. It defines canonical version output format (`scriptname X.Y.Z`), validation patterns for required arguments and option conflicts, and guidance on argument parsing placement (main function vs top-level) based on script complexity. These patterns ensure scripts are predictable, user-friendly, and maintainable for both interactive and automated usage.
