# Script Structure & Layout

This section defines the mandatory 13-step structural layout ensuring consistency, maintainability, and safe initialization. Covers organization from shebang through `#fin` marker, including metadata, shopt settings, dual-purpose patterns, FHS compliance, file extensions, and bottom-up function organization where low-level utilities precede high-level orchestration.
