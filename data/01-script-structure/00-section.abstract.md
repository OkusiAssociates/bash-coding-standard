# Script Structure & Layout

**All Bash scripts follow mandatory 13-step structural layout for consistency, safety, and maintainability.**

Covers: shebang → metadata → shopt → dual-purpose patterns → FHS compliance → file extensions → bottom-up function organization (utilities before orchestration).
