# Script Structure & Layout

This section defines the mandatory 13-step structural layout that all Bash scripts must follow, ensuring consistency, maintainability, and safe initialization. It covers the complete organization from shebang through the final `#fin` marker, including script metadata, shopt settings, dual-purpose script patterns, FHS compliance for system integration, file extension guidelines, and the bottom-up function organization principle where low-level utilities are defined before high-level orchestration functions.
