# Advanced Patterns

**Section covers 10 production-grade patterns:** debugging (`set -x`, PS4 customization), dry-run mode, secure temporary files (`mktemp`), environment variables, regex matching, background jobs, structured logging, performance profiling, testing methodologies, progressive state management.

**Core use cases:** Safe pre-deployment testing, performance optimization, robust error handling, maintainable state logic separating decision from execution.
