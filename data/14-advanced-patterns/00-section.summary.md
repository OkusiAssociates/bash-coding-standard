# Advanced Patterns

This section covers 10 advanced patterns for production-grade scripts: debugging (set -x, PS4 customization), dry-run mode for safe testing, secure temporary files with mktemp, environment variables, regular expressions, background job management, structured logging, performance profiling, testing methodologies, and progressive state management using boolean flags. These patterns address real-world challenges: safe pre-deployment testing, performance optimization, robust error handling, and maintainable state logic separating decision-making from execution.
