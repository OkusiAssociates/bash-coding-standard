# Arrays

This section covers array declaration and usage: indexed arrays (`declare -a`) and associative arrays (`declare -A`). Key topics include safe iteration with `"${array[@]}"` to prevent word-splitting, proper element access, and patterns for safely handling lists. Arrays provide a robust alternative to space/newline-separated strings and enable safe processing of filenames with spaces or special characters.
