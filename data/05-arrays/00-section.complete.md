## Arrays

This section covers proper array declaration and usage patterns in Bash, including both indexed arrays (`declare -a`) and associative arrays (`declare -A`). It addresses safe iteration techniques using `"${array[@]}"` to prevent word-splitting issues, proper array element access, and patterns for safely handling lists of items. Arrays provide a robust alternative to space/newline-separated strings and enable safe processing of filenames containing spaces or special characters.
