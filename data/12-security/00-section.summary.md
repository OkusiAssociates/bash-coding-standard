# Security Considerations

This section establishes security-first practices for production bash scripts, covering five critical areas: SUID/SGID prohibition (privilege escalation prevention), PATH security (command hijacking prevention), IFS safety (word-splitting vulnerability prevention), `eval` restrictions (injection risk mitigation), and input sanitization (validation and cleaning patterns). These practices prevent privilege escalation, command injection, path traversal, and other common attack vectors.
