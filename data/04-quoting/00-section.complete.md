## Quoting & String Literals

This comprehensive section establishes critical quoting rules that prevent word-splitting errors and make code intent clear. The fundamental principle is: single quotes (`'...'`) for static string literals, double quotes (`"..."`) when variable expansion, command substitution, or escape sequences are needed. This section covers 14 specific patterns: static strings and constants, one-word literals (which may be unquoted but quoting is defensive), strings containing variables, mixed quoting techniques, command substitution in strings, variables in conditionals (always quote), array expansions, here documents, echo and printf statements, common anti-patterns to avoid, string trimming operations, displaying declared variables, and pluralization helpers. Single quotes signal "literal text" while double quotes signal "shell processing needed"â€”this semantic distinction helps both human developers and AI assistants understand code intent immediately.
