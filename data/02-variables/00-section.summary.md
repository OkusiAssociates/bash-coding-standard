# Variable Declarations & Constants

Explicit variable declaration with type hints for clarity and safety. Covers type-specific declarations (`declare -i`, `declare --`, `declare -a`, `declare -A`), scoping (global vs local), naming conventions (UPPER_CASE constants, lower_case variables), readonly patterns for constants, boolean flag implementations using integers, and derived variable patterns. Ensures predictable behavior and prevents common shell scripting errors.
