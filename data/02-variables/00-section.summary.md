# Variable Declarations & Constants

Explicit variable declaration practices with type hints for clarity and safety. Covers type-specific declarations (`declare -i`, `declare --`, `declare -a`, `declare -A`), scoping rules (global vs local), naming conventions (UPPER_CASE constants, lower_case variables), readonly patterns (individual and group), boolean flags using integers, and derived variable patterns. These practices ensure predictable behavior and prevent common shell scripting errors.
