# Variable Declarations & Constants

This section establishes explicit variable declaration practices with type hints for clarity and safety. Covers type-specific declarations (`declare -i`, `declare --`, `declare -a`, `declare -A`), variable scoping (global vs local), naming conventions (UPPER_CASE for constants, lower_case for variables), readonly patterns (individual and group), boolean flags using integers, and derived variables computed from other variables. These practices ensure predictable behavior and prevent common shell scripting errors.
