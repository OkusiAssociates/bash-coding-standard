# AI Tooling for the Bash Coding Standard

**Agents, slash commands, and rule snapshots that turn BCS into an AI-assisted workflow**

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last updated:** 2026-04-13

## What This Is

`ai-agents/` is the enforcement layer for the [Bash Coding Standard](../data/BASH-CODING-STANDARD.md). It bundles conversational agents, slash-command macros, and policy rule snapshots that drop into Claude Code, opencode, or codex so any AI session you run becomes BCS-aware.

This README is the narrative introduction. For the flat machine-readable file index -- every agent, every command, every rule listed by name -- see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). The two files are complementary: AGENTS.md tells you *what* is in the package; this README tells you *why* it exists and *how* to use it.

## Why It Exists

BCS is 105 rules of static text. Reading the standard does not enforce it, and neither does quoting it at an AI. Two existing tools close that gap:

- `bcscheck` -- the on-demand AI compliance checker that scores a script against the full standard.
- `ai-agents/` -- the package in this directory, which wires BCS knowledge directly into everyday AI sessions so enforcement happens *while you write*, not only at check time.

The enforcement chain:

```
BCS document  →  bcscheck binary  →  ai-agents/ package  →  your AI session
   (rules)        (on-demand audit)    (always-on context)    (writes the code)
```

## Three Component Types

The package separates artifacts by semantics, not by topic. Each type has a different role and a different frontmatter schema.

### Agents (`agents/`)

Conversational personas loaded on demand. Agents are discursive -- they hold state across a multi-turn exchange, can call any tool the parent session allows, and behave like a specialist you hand off a task to. Frontmatter schema:

```yaml
---
name: bcs-auditor
description: |
  One-paragraph trigger description with example user prompts...
color: cyan
---
```

### Commands (`commands/`)

Slash-prefixed one-shot macros. Commands are narrow, sandboxed, and executed immediately -- not a conversation. Unlike agents, they declare an `allowed-tools` whitelist so the harness enforces the sandbox even if the macro tries to reach wider. Frontmatter schema:

```yaml
---
description: One-line summary shown in the slash menu
argument-hint: <file>
allowed-tools: ["Bash", "Read"]
---
```

Commands use `$ARGUMENTS` to receive user input and return a single structured response.

### Rules (`rules/`)

Plain markdown snapshots of policy documents -- BCS location search order, KISS principles, git commit authorship, security policy, documentation conventions, target environment. No frontmatter. The AI tool loads these as always-on context so every session starts with the same guardrails.

## Worked Example: The BCS Workflow

End-to-end flow for "write a new deployment script":

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a BCS-compliant skeleton
/scaffold basic deploy "Sync BCS repo to production servers"

# 2. Open the generated deploy file and fill in main() with your rsync/ssh logic.
#    The scaffold already has strict mode, metadata, and the 13-step skeleton.

# 3. Run the BCS auditor
/bcs-check deploy

# 4. If shellcheck warnings surface, hand them to the dedicated fixer
/fix-shellcheck deploy

# 5. Re-check, then commit
/bcs-check deploy
```

Each slash command delegates to `bcscheck`, `bcs template`, or `shellcheck` under the hood -- you stay in the AI session, the tooling stays honest, and the BCS rules travel with every step.

## Installation

From the BCS repo root, install into whichever AI tool you use:

```bash
# Claude Code
cp -r ai-agents/agents/*   ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r ai-agents/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r ai-agents/rules/*    ~/.claude/rules/

# opencode (sst) -- no rules/ subdir; treat ai-agents/rules/ as reference
cp -r ai-agents/agents/*   ~/.config/opencode/agents/
cp -r ai-agents/commands/* ~/.config/opencode/commands/

# codex (OpenAI) -- use ai-agents/AGENTS.md as project-context file
```

For the full per-tool matrix, the symlink alternative (updates track the repo), and codex caveats, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#installation).

## Inventory

Filenames and one-line descriptions for every agent, command, and rule live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). That file is the canonical index; this README intentionally does not duplicate it.

## Extending the Package

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/<name>.md` with the frontmatter skeleton:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: <name>
   description: |
     One paragraph on when to use this agent. Include 2-3
     <example>...</example> blocks showing user prompts and the
     assistant's trigger response.
   color: cyan
   ---
   ```
2. Keep `<name>` lowercase-kebab-case; it must match the filename.
3. Body: a system prompt in the second person ("You are a ...") with clear procedure, rules, and escalation hints.
4. Add a one-line entry to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) under `## Agents Index`.

### Adding a New Command

1. Create `commands/<name>.md` with:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: One-line summary
   argument-hint: <type> <name> [description]
   allowed-tools: ["Bash", "Read", "Edit"]
   ---
   ```
2. Use `$ARGUMENTS` in the body to reference user input. If a required argument is missing, ask the user -- never guess.
3. Keep `allowed-tools` as tight as possible. A read-only reporter needs `["Bash", "Read"]`, not the full toolset.
4. Add a one-line entry to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) under `## Commands Index`.

### Adding a New Rule

1. Create `rules/<topic>.md` as plain markdown -- no frontmatter.
2. Keep the rule file a snapshot of a single policy concern. Do not mix topics.
3. Add a one-line entry to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) under `## Rules Index`.

### Load-Bearing Convention

Every BCS-touching agent and command **must**:

- Call `bcscheck`, never `bcs check` directly. The shim reads `~/.config/bcs/bcs.conf` so the user's configured defaults win.
- Never hard-code `-m`, `-e`, or `-s`. Defer to config. Override only when the user explicitly asks for a different model, effort, or strict mode in the same turn.
- Preserve the BCS code on every reported finding so the user can look it up in `BASH-CODING-STANDARD.md`.

Hard-coded model names in these files silently break every user who has configured their own defaults. Don't do it.
