name: bcscheck
description: Claude-native BCS compliance audit sourced ONLY from BASH-CODING-STANDARD.md — no bcs script, no API keys. Use for "bcscheck <file>", "check this against BCS", "BCS compliance check", "is this BCS compliant", or "bcscheck <files>" typed in chat. Do NOT use when the user wants the real CLI tools executed (shellcheck + bcscheck binaries) — that is /bcs-audit.

# bcscheck — Claude-native BCS compliance audit

Audit Bash scripts against the Bash Coding Standard. You (Claude) are the
checker. The ONLY rule source is the assembled standard document; never rely
on memory of BCS rules. Report findings; NEVER auto-fix.

## 1. Resolve the standard (first match wins)

```bash
for d in ./data /usr/local/share/yatti/BCS/data /usr/share/yatti/BCS/data; do
  [[ -f "$d"/BASH-CODING-STANDARD.md ]] && { echo "$d"/BASH-CODING-STANDARD.md; break; }
done
```

If no match: STOP and report the three searched paths. Do not audit from
memory.

## 2. Gather static context (per target file)

```bash
shellcheck --format=json -x "$file"   # if shellcheck missing: proceed, note omission in report
grep -n '#bcscheck disable=BCS' "$file"
```

CAUTION: a `#bcscheck disable=` string inside a heredoc, prompt string, or
documentation text is CONTENT, not a directive. Only column-anchored comment
lines in live code are directives.

## 3. Dispatch (hybrid)

- **Inline**: exactly one target file AND it is already substantially in the
  conversation context → Read the standard and audit in-session.
- **Subagent fan-out** (everything else — multiple files, cold files, long
  session): dispatch one `bash-expert` subagent per file, in parallel. Each
  subagent prompt must include: absolute path of the standard, absolute path
  of the target, the shellcheck JSON, the detected disable directives with
  the heredoc caution above, the audit rules (§4), and the finding-line
  format (§5). Instruct: "return raw findings only, one per line, or
  NO FINDINGS".

## 4. Audit rules (binding)

1. Every finding cites a `BCS####` code that exists as a `## BCS####` header
   in the standard just read. Never invent codes.
2. Severity from the rule's `**Tier:**` line: core → ERROR;
   recommended or style → WARN.
3. Honour `#bcscheck disable=BCSdddd` with shellcheck-directive scope: the
   named rule is suppressed for the next command, function, or `{ ... }`
   block. Do not report suppressed findings.
4. Do not re-emit `SC####` findings as such; use shellcheck JSON only as
   anchoring context, and report a finding only when it maps to a specific
   BCS rule.
5. Verify each cited line number against the file before reporting.
6. Do not manufacture findings to seem useful; compliant code gets silence.

## 5. Output format

One line per finding:

```
file.bash:42 — BCS0301 [WARN] — Static string uses double quotes; use single quotes
```

Group by file, ERROR before WARN. End with:

| file | ERROR | WARN |
|------|------:|-----:|

and a verdict line: **FAIL** if any ERROR (core) finding, else **PASS**.
State shellcheck status (clean / N findings / not installed) and which
suppressions were honoured.

## 6. Error handling

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Standard not found | Stop; list the three searched paths |
| shellcheck missing | Proceed; note omission in report |
| Non-bash file argument | Warn and skip that file |
| No arguments, no obvious in-context target | Print usage `bcscheck <file...>` and stop |

## 7. Boundaries

- Report-only. Never edit the target. Offer fixes only as a follow-up the
  user must request.
- policy.conf, JSON output, caching, model/effort selection: out of scope — direct
  the user to the real `bcs check` for those.
